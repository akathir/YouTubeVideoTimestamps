# YouTubeVideoTimestamps

Adding timestamps to NumFOCUS and PyData YouTube videos!

## Get Involved

If you want to help add timestamps to the YouTube videos found here: https://www.youtube.com/c/PyDataTV, please follow the below steps:
- See the time stamps in the description here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGojI9xcCfg&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q2Kr16aWPOKE0dz9OnsnIJ&index=2 for an example of what you should do.
- Find a video without time stamps that interests you on the PyData YouTube channel
- Open a new issue with the videos title to "claim" the video such that there's no overlapping work
- Watch the video and add descriptive timestamps to the issue you opened
- Once the time stamps are accepted we will add a S/o to you in the video description as a thank you for your help! 

Thank you! #PyData #OpenSource #NumFOCUS
